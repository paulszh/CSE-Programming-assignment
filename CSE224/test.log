London. A Room in the Palace.\n\n[Enter the King Henry, Westmoreland, Sir Walter Blunt, and\nothers.]\n\nKING.\nSo shaken as we are, so wan with care,\nFind we '
b"a time for frighted peace to pant,\nAnd breathe short-winded accents of new broils\nTo be commenced in strands afar remote.\nNo more the thirsty entrance of this soil\nShall daub her lips with her own children's blood;\nNo more shall trenching war channel her fields,\nNor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs\nOf hostile paces:  those opposed eyes,\nWhich, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,\nAll of one nature, of one substance bred,\nDid lately meet in the intestine shock\nAnd furious close of civil butchery,\nShall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks,\nMarch all one way, and be no more opposed\nAgainst acquaintance, kindred, and allies:\nThe edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,\nNo more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,\nAs far as to the sepulchre of Christ--\nWhose soldier now, under whose blessed cross\nWe are impressed and engaged to fight--\nForthwith a power of English shall we levy,\nTo chase these pagans in those holy fields\nOver whose acres walk'd those blessed feet\nWhich fourteen hundred years ago we"
b"re nail'd\nFor our advantage on the bitter cross.\nBut this our purpose now is twelvemonth old,\nAnd bootless 'tis to tell you we will go:\nTherefore we meet not now.--Then let me hear\nOf you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,\nWhat yesternight our Council did decree\nIn forwarding this dear expedience.\n\nWEST.\nMy liege, this haste was hot in question,\nAnd many limits of the charge set down\nBut yesternight; when, all athwart, there came\nA post from Wales loaden with heavy news;\nWhose worst was, that the noble Mortimer,\nLeading the men of Herefordshire to fight\nAgainst th' irregular and wild Glendower,\nWas by the rude hands of that Welshman taken;\nA thousand of his people butchered,\nUpon whose dead corpse' there was such misuse,\nSuch beastly, shameless transformation,\nBy those Welshwomen done, as may not be\nWithout much shame re-told or spoken of.\n\nKING.\nIt seems, then, that the tidings of this broil\nBrake off our business for the Holy Land.\n\nWEST.\nThis, match'd with other, did, my gracious lord;\nFor more uneven and unw"
b"elcome news\nCame from the North, and thus it did import:\nOn Holy-rood day the gallant Hotspur there,\nYoung Harry Percy, and brave Archibald,\nThat ever-valiant and approved Scot,\nAt Holmedon met;\nWhere they did spend a sad and bloody hour,\nAs by discharge of their artillery,\nAnd shape of likelihood, the news was told;\nFor he that brought them, in the very heat\nAnd pride of their contention did take horse,\nUncertain of the issue any way.\n\nKING.\nHere is a dear and true-industrious friend,\nSir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse,\nStain'd with the variation of each soil\nBetwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours;\nAnd he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.\nThe Earl of Douglas is discomfited:\nTen thousand bold Scots, two-and-twenty knights,\nBalk'd in their own blood, did Sir Walter see\nOn Holmedon's plains:  of prisoners, Hotspur took\nMordake the Earl of Fife and eldest son\nTo beaten Douglas; and the Earls of Athol,\nOf Murray, Angus, and Menteith.\nAnd is not this an honourable spoil,\nA gallant prize? ha, "
b"cousin, is it not?\n\nWEST.\nFaith, 'tis a conquest for a prince to boast of.\n\nKING.\nYea, there thou makest me sad, and makest me sin\nIn envy that my Lord Northumberland\nShould be the father to so blest a son,--\nA son who is the theme of honour's tongue;\nAmongst a grove, the very straightest plant;\nWho is sweet Fortune's minion and her pride:\nWhilst I, by looking on the praise of him,\nSee riot and dishonour stain the brow\nOf my young Harry. O, that it could be proved\nThat some night-tripping fairy had exchanged\nIn cradle-clothes our children where they lay,\nAnd call'd mine Percy, his Plantagenet!\nThen would I have his Harry, and he mine:\nBut let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,\nOf this young Percy's pride? the prisoners,\nWhich he in this adventure hath surprised,\nTo his own use he keeps; and sends me word,\nI shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife.\n\nWEST.\nThis is his uncle's teaching, this is Worcester,\nMalevolent to you in all aspects;\nWhich makes him prune himself, and bristle up\nThe crest of youth "
b"against your dignity.\n\nKING.\nBut I have sent for him to answer this;\nAnd for this cause awhile we must neglect\nOur holy purpose to Jerusalem.\nCousin, on Wednesday next our Council we\nWill hold at Windsor; so inform the lords:\nBut come yourself with speed to us again;\nFor more is to be said and to be done\nThan out of anger can be uttered.\n\nWEST.\nI will, my liege.\n\n\n[Exeunt.]\n\n\n\nScene II. The same. An Apartment of Prince Henry's.\n\n[Enter Prince Henry and Falstaff.]\n\nFAL.\nNow, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?\n\nPRINCE.\nThou art so fat-witted, with drinking of old sack, and\nunbuttoning thee after supper, and sleeping upon benches\nafter noon, that thou hast forgotten to demand that truly which\nthou wouldst truly know. What a devil hast thou to do with the\ntime of the day? unless hours were cups of sack, and minutes\ncapons, and the blessed Sun himself a fair hot wench in\nflame-coloured taffeta, I see no reason why thou shouldst be\nso superfluous to demand the time of the day.\n\nFAL.\nIndeed, you come near me now, Hal"
b"; for we that take purses go\nby the Moon and the seven stars, and not by Phoebus,--he, that\nwandering knight so fair. And I pr'ythee, sweet wag, when thou\nart king,--as, God save thy Grace--Majesty I should say, for\ngrace\nthou wilt have none,--\n\nPRINCE.\nWhat, none?\n\nFAL.\nNo, by my troth; not so much as will serve to be prologue\nto an egg and butter.\n\nPRINCE.\nWell, how then? come, roundly, roundly.\n\nFAL.\nMarry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not us that\nare squires of the night's body be called thieves of the day's\nbeauty:  let us be Diana's foresters, gentlemen of the shade,\nminions of the Moon; and let men say we be men of good\ngovernment, being governed, as the sea is, by our noble and\nchaste mistress the Moon, under whose countenance we steal.\n\n\nPRINCE.\nThou say'st well, and it holds well too; for the fortune of\nus that are the Moon's men doth ebb and flow like the sea,\nbeing governed, as the sea is, by the Moon. As, for proof, now: A\npurse of gold most resolutely snatch'd on Monday night, and mo"
b"st\ndissolutely spent on Tuesday morning; got with swearing Lay by,\nand spent with crying Bring in; now ill as low an ebb as the foot\nof the ladder, and by-and-by in as high a flow as the ridge of the\ngallows.\n\nFAL.\nBy the Lord, thou say'st true, lad.  And is not my hostess of the\ntavern a most sweet wench?\n\nPRINCE.\nAs the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle.  And is not a\nbuff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?\n\nFAL.\nHow now, how now, mad wag! what, in thy quips and thy\nquiddities? what a plague have I to do with a buff jerkin?\n\nPRINCE.\nWhy, what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern?\n\nFAL.\nWell, thou hast call'd her to a reckoning many a time and oft.\n\nPRINCE.\nDid I ever call for thee to pay thy part?\n\nFAL.\nNo; I'll give thee thy due, thou hast paid all there.\n\nPRINCE.\nYea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would stretch;\nand where it would not, I have used my credit.\n\nFAL.\nYea, and so used it, that, were it not here apparent that\nthou art heir-apparent--But I pr'ythee, sweet wag, shall ther"
b"e be\ngallows standing in England when thou art king? and\nresolution thus fobb'd as it is with the rusty curb of old father\nantic the law? Do not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief.\n\nPRINCE.\nNo; thou shalt.\n\nFAL.\nShall I? O rare! By the Lord, I'll be a brave judge.\n\nPRINCE.\nThou judgest false already:  I mean, thou shalt have the\nhanging of the thieves, and so become a rare hangman.\n\nFAL.\nWell, Hal, well; and in some sort it jumps with my humour;\nas well as waiting in the Court, I can tell you.\n\nPRINCE.\nFor obtaining of suits?\n\nFAL.\nYea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the hangman hath no\nlean wardrobe. 'Sblood, I am as melancholy as a gib-cat or a\nlugg'd bear.\n\nPRINCE.\nOr an old lion, or a lover's lute.\n\nFAL.\nYea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe.\n\nPRINCE.\nWhat say'st thou to a hare, or the melancholy of Moor-ditch?\n\nFAL.\nThou hast the most unsavoury similes, and art, indeed, the\nmost comparative, rascalliest, sweet young prince,--But, Hal, I\npr'ythee trouble me no more with vanity. I would to God t"
b"hou and\nI knew where a commodity of good names were to be bought. An old\nlord of the Council rated me the other day in the street about you,\nsir,--but I mark'd him not; and yet he talk'd very wisely,--but I\nregarded him not; and yet he talk'd wisely, and in the street too.\n\nPRINCE.\nThou didst well; for wisdom cries out in the streets, and no man\nregards it.\n\nFAL.\nO, thou hast damnable iteration, and art, indeed, able to corrupt\na saint.\nThou hast done much harm upon me, Hal; God forgive thee for it!\nBefore I knew thee, Hal, I knew nothing; and now am I, if a man\nshould speak truly, little better than one of the wicked. I must\ngive over this life, and I will give it over; by the Lord, an I do\nnot, I am a villain:  I'll be damn'd for never a king's son in\nChristendom.\n\nPRINCE.\nWhere shall we take a purse to-morrow, Jack?\n\nFAL.\nZounds, where thou wilt, lad; I'll make one:  an I do not, call\nme villain, and baffle me.\n\nPRINCE.\nI see a good amendment of life in thee,--from praying to\npurse-taking.\n\nFAL.\nWhy, Hal, "
b"'tis my vocation, Hal; 'tis no sin for a man to labour\nin his vocation.\n\n[Enter Pointz.]\n\n--Pointz!--Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a match. O, if\nmen were to be saved by merit, what hole in Hell were hot enough\nfor him? This is the most omnipotent villain that ever cried\nStand! to a true man.\n\nPRINCE.\nGood morrow, Ned.\n\nPOINTZ.\nGood morrow, sweet Hal.--What says Monsieur Remorse? what\nsays Sir John Sack-and-sugar? Jack, how agrees the Devil and\nthee about thy soul, that thou soldest him on Good-Friday last\nfor a cup of Madeira and a cold capon's leg?\n\nPRINCE.\nSir John stands to his word,--the Devil shall have his bargain;\nfor he was never yet a breaker of proverbs,--he will give the\nDevil his due.\n\nPOINTZ.\nThen art thou damn'd for keeping thy word with the Devil.\n\nPRINCE.\nElse he had been damn'd for cozening the Devil.\n\n\nPOINTZ.\nBut, my lads, my lads, to-morrow morning, by four o'clock,\nearly at Gads-hill! there are pilgrims gong to Canterbury\nwith rich offerings, and traders riding to London with fa"
b"t\npurses: I have visards for you all; you have horses for\nyourselves:  Gadshill lies to-night in Rochester:  I have bespoke\nsupper to-morrow night in Eastcheap:  we may do it as secure as\nsleep. If you will go, I will stuff your purses full of crowns;\nif you will not, tarry at home and be hang'd.\n\nFAL.\nHear ye, Yedward; if I tarry at home and go not, I'll hang you\nfor going.\n\nPOINTZ.\nYou will, chops?\n\nFAL.\nHal, wilt thou make one?\n\nPRINCE.\nWho, I rob? I a thief? not I, by my faith.\n\nFAL.\nThere's neither honesty, manhood, nor good fellowship in thee,\nnor thou camest not of the blood royal, if thou darest not stand\nfor ten shillings.\n\nPRINCE.\nWell, then, once in my days I'll be a madcap.\n\nFAL.\nWhy, that's well said.\n\nPRINCE.\nWell, come what will, I'll tarry at home.\n\nFAL.\nBy the Lord, I'll be a traitor, then, when thou art king.\n\nPRINCE.\nI care not.\n\nPOINTZ.\n\nSir John, I pr'ythee, leave the Prince and me alone: I will\nlay him down such reasons for this adventure, that he shall go.\n\nFAL.\nWell, God give thee the "
b"spirit of persuasion, and him the ears\nof profiting, that what thou speakest may move, and what he\nhears may be believed, that the true Prince may, for recreation-\nsake, prove a false thief; for the poor abuses of the time want\ncountenance. Farewell; you shall find me in Eastcheap.\n\nPRINCE.\nFarewell, thou latter Spring! farewell, All-hallown Summer!\n\n[Exit Falstaff.]\n\nPOINTZ.\nNow, my good sweet honey-lord, ride with us to-morrow:  I\nhave a jest to execute that I cannot manage alone. Falstaff,\nBardolph, Peto, and Gadshill, shall rob those men that we have\nalready waylaid:  yourself and I will not be there; and when they\nhave the booty, if you and I do not rob them, cut this head off\nfrom my shoulders.\n\nPRINCE.\nBut how shall we part with them in setting forth?\n\nPOINTZ.\nWhy, we will set forth before or after them, and appoint them\na place of meeting, wherein it is at our pleasure to fail; and\nthen will they adventure upon the exploit themselves; which they\nshall have no sooner achieved but we'll set upon them.\n\n"
b"PRINCE.\nAy, but 'tis like that they will know us by our horses, by our\nhabits, and by every other appointment, to be ourselves.\n\nPOINTZ.\nTut! our horses they shall not see,--I'll tie them in the wood;\nour visards we will change, after we leave them; and, sirrah, I\nhave cases of buckram for the nonce, to immask our noted\noutward garments.\n\nPRINCE.\nBut I doubt they will be too hard for us.\n\nPOINTZ.\nWell, for two of them, I know them to be as true-bred\ncowards as ever turn'd back; and for the third, if he fight\nlonger than he sees reason, I'll forswear arms. The virtue of\nthis jest will be, the incomprehensible lies that this same fat\nrogue will tell us when we meet at supper: how thirty, at least,\nhe fought with; what wards, what blows, what extremities he\nendured; and in the reproof of this lies the jest.\n\nPRINCE.\nWell, I'll go with thee:  provide us all things necessary and\nmeet me to-night in Eastcheap; there I'll sup. Farewell.\n\nPOINTZ.\nFarewell, my lord.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nPRINCE.\nI know you all, and will awhile up"
b"hold\nThe unyok'd humour of your idleness:\nYet herein will I imitate the Sun,\nWho doth permit the base contagious clouds\nTo smother-up his beauty"
b" from the world,\nThat, when he please again to be himself,\nBeing wanted, he may be more wonder'd at,\nBy breaking through the foul and ugly mists\nOf vapours that did seem to strangle him.\nIf all the year were playing holidays,\nTo sport would be as tedious as to work;\nBut, when they seldom come, they wish'd-for come,\nAnd nothing pleaseth but rare accidents.\nSo, when this loose behaviour I throw off,\nAnd pay the debt I never promised,\nBy how much better than my word I am,\nBy so much shall I falsify men's hopes;\nAnd, like bright metal on a sullen ground,\nMy reformation, glittering o'er my fault,\nShall show more goodly and attract more eyes\nThan that which hath no foil to set it off.\nI'll so offend, to make offence a skill;\nRedeeming time, when men think least I will.\n\n[Exit.]\n\n\n\n\nScene III. The Same.  A Room in the Palace.\n\n[Enter King Henry, Northumberland, Worcester, Hotspur, Sir Walter\nBlunt, and others.]\n\nKING.\nMy blood hath been too cold and temperate,\nUnapt to stir at these indignities,\nAnd you have found m"
b"e; for, accordingly,\nYou tread upon my patience:  but be sure\nI will from henceforth rather be myself,\nMighty and to be fear'd, than my condition,\nWhich hath been smooth as oil, soft as young down,\nAnd therefore lost that title of respect\nWhich the proud soul ne'er pays but to the proud.\n\nWOR.\nOur House, my sovereign liege, little deserves\nThe scourge of greatness to be used on it;\nAnd that same greatness too which our own hands\nHave holp to make so portly.\n\nNORTH.\nMy good lord,--\n\nKING.\nWorcester, get thee gone; for I do see\nDanger and disobedience in thine eye:\nO, sir, your presence is too bold and peremptory,\nAnd majesty might never yet endure\nThe moody frontier of a servant brow.\nYou have good leave to leave us:  when we need\nYour use and counsel, we shall send for you.\n\n[Exit Worcester.]\n\n[To Northumberland.]\n\nYou were about to speak.\n\nNORTH.\nYea, my good lord.\nThose prisoners in your Highness' name demanded,\nWhich Harry Percy here at Holmedon took,\nWere, as he says, not with such strength denied\nAs is d"
b"eliver'd to your Majesty:\nEither envy, therefore, or misprision\nIs guilty of this fault, and not my son.\n\nHOT.\nMy liege, I did deny no prisoners.\nBut, I remember, when the fight was done,\nWhen I was dry with rage and extreme toil,\nBreathless and faint, leaning upon my sword,\nCame there a certain lord, neat, trimly dress'd,\nFresh as a bridegroom; and his chin new reap'd\nShow'd like a stubble-land at harvest-home:\nHe was perfumed like a milliner;\nAnd 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held\nA pouncet-box, which ever and anon\nHe gave his nose, and took't away again;\nWho therewith angry, when it next came there,\nTook it in snuff:  and still he smiled and talk'd;\nAnd, as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,\nHe call'd them untaught knaves, unmannerly,\nTo bring a slovenly unhandsome corse\nBetwixt the wind and his nobility.\nWith many holiday and lady terms\nHe question'd me; amongst the rest, demanded\nMy prisoners in your Majesty's behalf.\nI then, all smarting with my wounds being cold,\nOut of my grief and my impatience\nT"
b"o be so pester'd with a popinjay,\nAnswer'd neglectingly, I know not what,--\nHe should, or he should not; for't made me mad\nTo see him shine so brisk, and smell so sweet,\nAnd talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman\nOf guns and drums and wounds,--God save the mark!--\nAnd telling me the sovereign'st thing on Earth\nWas parmaceti for an inward bruise;\nAnd that it was great pity, so it was,\nThis villainous salt-petre should be digg'd\nOut of the bowels of the harmless earth,\nWhich many a good tall fellow had destroy'd\nSo cowardly; and, but for these vile guns,\nHe would himself have been a soldier.\nThis bald unjointed chat of his, my lord,\nI answered indirectly, as I said;\nAnd I beseech you, let not his report\nCome current for an accusation\nBetwixt my love and your high Majesty.\n\nBLUNT.\nThe circumstance consider'd, good my lord,\nWhatever Harry Percy then had said\nTo such a person, and in such a place,\nAt such a time, with all the rest re-told,\nMay reasonably die, and never rise\nTo do him wrong, or any way impeach\nWhat the"
b"n he said, so he unsay it now.\n\nKING.\nWhy, yet he doth deny his prisoners,\nBut with proviso and exception,\nThat we at our own charge shall ransom straight\nHis brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer;\nWho, on my soul, hath wilfully betray'd\nThe lives of those that he did lead to fight\nAgainst that great magician, damn'd Glendower,\nWhose daughter, as we hear, the Earl of March\nHath lately married. Shall our coffers, then,\nBe emptied to redeem a traitor home?\nShall we buy treason? and indent with fears\nWhen they have lost and forfeited themselves?\nNo, on the barren mountains let him starve;\nFor I shall never hold that man my friend\nWhose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost\nTo ransom home revolted Mortimer.\n\nHOT.\nRevolted Mortimer!\nHe never did fall off, my sovereign liege,\nBut by the chance of war:  to prove that true\nNeeds no more but one tongue for all those wounds,\nThose mouthed wounds, which valiantly he took,\nWhen on the gentle Severn's sedgy bank,\nIn single opposition, hand to hand,\nHe did confound the bes"
b"t part of an hour\nIn changing hardiment with great Glendower.\nThree times they breathed, and three times did they drink,\nUpon agreement, of swift Severn's flood;\nWho then, affrighted with their bloody looks,\nRan fearfully among the trembling reeds,\nAnd hid his crisp head in the hollow bank\nBlood-stained with these valiant combatants.\nNever did base and rotten policy\nColour her working with such deadly wounds;\nNor never could the noble Mortimer\nReceive so many, and all willingly:\nThen let not him be slander'd with revolt.\n\nKING.\nThou dost belie him, Percy, thou dost belie him;\nHe never did encounter with Glendower:\nI tell thee,\nHe durst as well have met the Devil alone\nAs Owen Glendower for an enemy.\nArt not ashamed? But, sirrah, henceforth\nLet me not hear you speak of Mortimer:\nSend me your prisoners with the speediest means,\nOr you shall hear in such a kind from me\nAs will displease you.--My Lord Northumberland,\nWe license your departure with your son.--\nSend us your prisoners, or you'll hear of it.\n\n[Exeunt"
b" King Henry, Blunt, and train.]\n\nHOT.\nAn if the Devil come and roar for them,\nI will not send them:  I will after straight,\nAnd tell him so; for I will else my heart,\nAlthough it be with hazard of my head.\n\nNORTH.\nWhat, drunk with choler? stay, and pause awhile:\nHere comes your uncle.\n\n[Re-enter Worcester.]\n\nHOT.\nSpeak of Mortimer!\nZounds, I will speak of him; and let my soul\nWant mercy, if I do not join with him:\nYea, on his part I'll empty all these veins,\nAnd shed my dear blood drop by drop i' the dust,\nBut I will lift the down-trod Mortimer\nAs high i' the air as this unthankful King,\nAs this ingrate and canker'd Bolingbroke.\n\nNORTH.\n\n[To Worcester.]\n\nBrother, the King hath made your nephew mad.\n\nWOR.\nWho struck this heat up after I was gone?\n\nHOT.\nHe will, forsooth, have all my prisoners;\nAnd when I urged the ransom once again\nOf my wife's brother, then his cheek look'd pale,\nAnd on my face he turn'd an eye of death,\nTrembling even at the name of Mortimer.\n\nWOR.\nI cannot blame him:  was not he proclaim'd\n"
b"By Richard that dead is the next of blood?\n\nNORTH.\nHe was; I heard the proclamation:\nAnd then it was when the unhappy King--\nWhose wrongs in us God pardon!--did set forth\nUpon his Irish expedition;\nFrom whence he intercepted did return\nTo be deposed, and shortly murdered.\n\nWOR.\nAnd for whose death we in the world's wide mouth\nLive scandalized and foully spoken of.\n\nHOT.\nBut, soft! I pray you; did King Richard then\nProclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer\nHeir to the crown?\n\nNORTH.\nHe did; myself did hear it.\n\nHOT.\nNay, then I cannot blame his cousin King,\nThat wish'd him on the barren mountains starve.\nBut shall it be, that you, that set the crown\nUpon the head of this forgetful man,\nAnd for his sake wear the detested blot\nOf murderous subornation,--shall it be,\nThat you a world of curses undergo,\nBeing the agents, or base second means,\nThe cords, the ladder, or the hangman rather?--\nO, pardon me, that I descend so low,\nTo show the line and the predicament\nWherein you range under this subtle King;--\nShall it, for "
b"shame, be spoken in these days,\nOr fill up chronicles in time to come,\nThat men of your nobility and power\nDid gage them both in an unjust behalf,--\nAs both of you, God pardon it! have done,--\nTo put down Richard, that sweet lovely rose,\nAnd plant this thorn, this canker, Bolingbroke?\nAnd shall it, in more shame, be further spoken,\nThat you are fool'd, discarded, and shook off\nBy him for whom these shames ye underwent?\nNo! yet time serves, wherein you may redeem\nYour banish'd honours, and restore yourselves\nInto the good thoughts of the world again;\nRevenge the jeering and disdain'd contempt\nOf this proud King, who studies day and night\nTo answer all the debt he owes to you\nEven with the bloody payment of your deaths:\nTherefore, I say,--\n\nWOR.\nPeace, cousin, say no more:\nAnd now I will unclasp a secret book,\nAnd to your quick-conceiving discontent\nI'll read you matter deep and dangerous;\nAs full of peril and adventurous spirit\nAs to o'er-walk a current roaring loud\nOn the unsteadfast footing of a spear.\n\nHOT."
b"\nIf we fall in, good night, or sink or swim!\nSend danger from the east unto the west,\nSo honour cross it from the north to south,\nAnd let them grapple. O, the blood more stirs\nTo rouse a lion than to start a hare!\n\nNORTH.\nImagination of some great exploit\nDrives him beyond the bounds of patience.\n\nHOT.\nBy Heaven, methinks it were an easy leap,\nTo pluck bright honour from the pale-faced Moon;\nOr dive into the bottom of the deep,\nWhere fathom-line could never touch the ground,\nAnd pluck up drowned honour by the locks;\nSo he that doth redeem her thence might wear\nWithout corrival all her dignities:\nBut out upon this half-faced fellowship!\n\nWOR.\nHe apprehends a world of figures here,\nBut not the form of what he should attend.--\nGood cousin, give me audience for a while.\n\nHOT.\nI cry you mercy.\n\nWOR.\nThose same noble Scots\nThat are your prisoners,--\n\nHOT.\nI'll keep them all;\nBy God, he shall not have a Scot of them;\nNo, if a Scot would save his soul, he shall not:\nI'll keep them, by this hand.\n\nWOR.\nYou start away,"

It holds current that I told\nyou yesternight:  there's a franklin in the wild of Kent hath\nbrought three hundred marks with him in gold:  I heard him\ntell it to one of his company last night at su"
b"pper; a kind of\nauditor; one that hath abundance of charge too, God knows what.\nThey are up already, and call for eggs and butter; they will away\npresently.\n\nGADS.\nSirrah, if they meet not with Saint Nicholas' clerks, I'll give\nthee this neck.\n\nCHAM.\nNo, I'll none of it: I pr'ythee, keep that for the hangman; for\nI know thou worshippest Saint Nicholas as truly as a man of\nfalsehood may.\n\nGADS.\nWhat talkest thou to me of the hangman? if I hang, I'll make\na fat pair of gallows; for, if I hang, old Sir John hangs with\nme, and thou know'st he is no starveling. Tut! there are other\nTrojans that thou dreamest not of, the which, for sport-sake,\nare content to do the profession some grace; that would, if\nmatters should be look'd into, for their own credit-sake, make\nall whole. I am joined with no foot land-rakers, no long-staff\nsixpenny strikers, none of these mad mustachio purple-hued\nmalt-worms; but with nobility and tranquillity, burgomasters and\ngreat oneyers; such as can hold in, such as will strike sooner\nthan "
b"speak, and speak sooner than drink, and drink sooner than\npray:  and yet, zwounds, I lie; for they pray continually to their\nsaint, the Commonwealth; or, rather, not pray to her, but prey on\nher, for they ride up and down on her, and make her their boots.\n\nCHAM.\nWhat, the Commonwealth their boots? will she hold out water\nin foul way?\n\nGADS.\nShe will, she will; justice hath liquor'd her. We steal as in a\ncastle, cock-sure; we have the receipt of fernseed,--we walk\ninvisible.\n\nCHAM.\nNay, by my faith, I think you are more beholding to the night\nthan to fern-seed for your walking invisible.\n\nGADS.\nGive me thy hand:  thou shalt have a share in our purchase, as\nI am a true man.\n\n\nCHAM.\nNay, rather let me have it, as you are a false thief.\n\nGADS.\nGo to; homo is a common name to all men.

If I travel but\nfour foot by the squire further a-foot, I shall break my wind.\nWell, I doubt not but to die a fair death for all this, if I 'scape\nhanging for killing that rogue. I have forsworn his company hourly\nany time this two-and-twenty year, and yet I am bewitch'd with the\nrogue's company. If the rascal have not given me medicines to make\nme love him, I'll be hang'd; it could not be else:  I have drunk\nmedicines.--\nPointz!--Hal!--a plague upon you both!--Bardolph!--Peto!--I'll\nstarve, ere I'll rob a foot further.

In respect of the love he bears\nour House!--he shows in this, he loves his own barn better than he\nloves our house. Let me see some more. The purpose you undertake\nis dangerous;--Why, that's certain:  'tis dangerous to take a cold,\nto sleep, to drink; but I tell you, my lord fool, out of this nettle,\ndanger, we pluck this flower, safety. The purpose you undertake is\ndangerous; the friends you have named uncertain; the time itself\nunsorted; and your whole plot too light for the counterpoise of so\ngreat an opposition.--\nSay you so, say you so?  I say unto you again, you are a shallow,\ncowardly hind, and you lie. What a lack-bra"
b"in is this! By the Lord,\nour plot is a good plot as ever was laid; our friends true and\nconstant: a good plot, good friends, and full of expectation; an\nexcellent plot, very good friends. What a frosty-spirited rogue is\nthis! Why, my Lord of York commends the plot and the general course\nof the action. Zwounds! an I were now by this rascal, I could brain\nhim with his lady's fan. Is there not my father, my uncle, and\nmyself? Lord Edmund Mortimer, my Lord of York, and Owen Glendower?\nis there not, besides, the Douglas? have I not all their letters to\nmeet me in arms by the ninth of the next month? and are they not\nsome of them set forward already? What a pagan rascal is this! an\ninfidel! Ha! you shall see now, in very sincerity of fear and cold\nheart, will he to the King, and lay open all our proceedings. O, I\ncould divide myself, and go to buffets, for moving such a dish of\nskimm'd milk with so honourable an action!\nHang him! let him tell the King:  we are prepared.

b"d Jack:  die\nwhen thou wilt, if manhood, good manhood, be not forgot upon the face\nof the Earth, then am I a shotten herring. There live not three good\nmen unhang'd in England; and one of them is fat, and grows old: God\nhelp the while! a bad world, I say.\nI would I were a weaver; I could sing psalms or any thing. A plague of\nall cowards! I say still.\n\nPRINCE.\nHow now, wool-sack? what mutter you?\n\nFAL.\nA king's son! If I do not beat thee out of thy kingdom with a dagger\nof lath, and drive all thy subjects afore thee like a flock of\nwild-geese, I'll never wear hair on my face more.

I have 'scaped by miracle. I am eight times thrust\nthrough the doublet, four through the hose; my buckler cut through\nand through; my sword hack'd like a hand-saw,--ecce signum! I never\ndealt better since I was a man:  all would not do. A plague of all\ncowards! Let them speak:  if they speak more or less than truth,\nthey are villains and the sons of "
b"darkness.\n\nPRINCE.\nSpeak, sirs; how was it?\n\nGADS.\nWe four set upon some dozen,--\n\nFAL.\nSixteen at least, my lord.\n\nGADS.\n--and bound them.\n\nPETO.\nNo, no; they were not bound.\n\nFAL.\nYou rogue, they were bound, every man of them; or I am a Jew\nelse, an Ebrew Jew.\n\nGADS.\nAs we were sharing, some six or seven fresh men sea upon us,--\n\nFAL.\nAnd unbound the rest, and then come in the other.\n\nPRINCE.\nWhat, fought you with them all?\n\n\nFAL.\nAll? I know not what you call all; but if I fought not with fifty\nof them, I am a bunch of radish:  if there were not two or three\nand fifty upon poor old Jack, then am I no two-legged creature.\n\nPRINCE.\nPray God you have not murdered some of them.\n\nFAL.\nNay, that's past praying for: I have pepper'd two of them; two I\nam sure I have paid, two rogues in buckram suits. I tell thee what,\nHal, if I tell thee a lie, spit in my face, call me horse.\nThou knowest my old ward:  here I lay, and thus I bore my point.\nFour rogues in buckram let drive at me,--\n\nPRINCE.\nWhat, four? thou saidst "
b"but two even now.\n\nFAL.\nFour, Hal; I told thee four.\n\nPOINTZ.\nAy, ay, he said four.\n\nFAL.\nThese four came all a-front, and mainly thrust at me.

b"t was so dark, Hal,\nthat thou couldst not see thy hand.\n\nPRINCE.\nThese lies are like the father that begets them, gross as a mountain,\nopen, palpable. Why, thou nott-pated fool, thou whoreson, obscene\ngreasy tallow-keech,--\n\nFAL.\nWhat, art thou mad? art thou mad? is not the truth the truth?\n\nPRINCE.\nWhy, how couldst thou know these men in Kendal green, when it was\nso dark thou couldst not see thy hand? come, tell us your reason:\nwhat sayest thou to this?\n\nPOINTZ.\nCome, your reason, Jack, your reason.\n\nFAL.\nWhat, upon compulsion? No; were I at the strappado, or all the racks\nin the world, I would not tell you on compulsion. Give you a reason on\ncompulsion! if reasons were as plentiful as blackberries, I would\ngive no man a reason upon compulsion, I.\n\nPRINCE.\nI'll be no longer guilty of this sin; this sanguine coward, this\nbed-presser, this horse-back-breaker, this huge hill of flesh,--\n\nFAL.\nAway, you starveling, you eel-skin, you dried neat's-tongue, you\nstock-fish,--\nO, for breath to utter what is like thee!"

What a slave art thou, to hack thy sword as thou\nhast done, and then say it was in fight!\nWhat trick, what device, what starting-hole canst thou now find\nout to hide thee from this open and apparent shame?\n\nPOINTZ.\nCome, let's hear, Jack; what trick hast thou now?\n\nFAL.\nBy the Lord, I knew ye as well as he that made ye. Why, hear ye,\nmy masters:\nWas it for me"
b" to kill the heir-apparent? should I turn upon the\ntrue Prince? why, thou knowest I am as valiant as Hercules:  but\nbeware instinct; the lion will not touch the true Prince.\nInstinct is a great matter; I was now a coward on instinct.\nI shall think the better of myself and thee during my life; I for a\nvaliant lion, and thou for a true prince.  But, by the Lord, lads,\nI am glad you have the money.--\n[To Hostess within.]  Hostess, clap-to the doors:  watch\nto-night, pray to-morrow.--Gallants, lads, boys, hearts of gold,\nall the titles of good fellowship come to you!\nWhat, shall we be merry? shall we have a play extempore?\n\nPRINCE.\nContent; and the argument shall be thy running away.\n\nFAL.\nAh, no more of that, Hal, an thou lovest me!\n\n[Enter the Hostess.]\n\nHOST.\nO Jesu, my lord the Prince,--\n\nPRINCE.\nHow now, my lady the hostess!

I did that I did not this seven year before;\nI blush'd to hear his monstrous devices.\n\nPRINCE.\nO villain, thou stolest a cup of sack"

How long is't ago, Jack,\nsince thou saw'st thine own knee?\n\n\nFAL.\nMy own knee! when I was about thy years, Hal, I was not an eagle's\ntalon in the waist; I could have crept into any alderman's thumb-ring:\na plague of sighing and grief! it blows a man up like a bladder.\nThere's villanous news abroad:  here was Sir John Bracy from your\nfather; you must to the Court in the morning.\nThat same mad fellow of the North, Percy; and he of Wales, that gave\nAmaimon the bastinado, and s"
b"wore the Devil his true liegeman upon the\ncross of a Welsh hook,--what a plague call you him?\n\nPOINTZ.\nO, Glendower.\n\nFAL.\nOwen, Owen,--the same; and his son-in-law Mortimer; and old\nNorthumberland; and that sprightly Scot of Scots, Douglas, that\nruns o' horseback up a hill perpendicular,--\n\nPRINCE.\nHe that rides at high speed and with his pistol kills a sparrow\nflying.\n\nFAL.\nYou have hit it.\n\nPRINCE.\nSo did he never the sparrow.\n\nFAL.\nWell, that rascal hath good metal in him; he will not run.\n\nPRINCE.\nWhy, what a rascal art thou, then, to praise him so for running!\n\nFAL.\nO' horseback, ye cuckoo! but a-foot he will not budge a foot.\n\nPRINCE.\nYes, Jack, upon instinct.\n\nFAL.\nI grant ye, upon instinct. Well, he is there too, and one Mordake,\nand a thousand blue-caps more:\nWorcester is stolen away to-night; thy father's beard is turn'd\nwhite with the news:  you may buy land now as cheap as stinking\nmackerel.\nBut, tell me, Hal, art not thou horrible afeard? thou being\nheir-apparent, could the world pick thee out t"
b"hree such enemies again\nas that fiend Douglas, that spirit Percy, and that devil Glendower?\nart thou not horribly afraid? doth not thy blood thrill at it?\n\nPRINCE.\nNot a whit, i'faith; I lack some of thy instinct.\n\nFAL.\nWell, thou wilt be horribly chid to-morrow when thou comest to\nthy father.  If thou love life, practise an answer.\n\nPRINCE.\nDo thou stand for my father and examine me upon the particulars\nof my life.\n\nFAL.\nShall I? content:  this chair shall be my state, this dagger my\nsceptre, and this cushion my crown.\n\nPRINCE.\nThy state is taken for a joint-stool, thy golden sceptre for a\nleaden dagger, and thy precious rich crown for a pitiful bald crown.\n\nFAL.\nWell, an the fire of grace be not quite out of thee, now shalt\nthou be moved.--\nGive me a cup of sack, to make my eyes look red, that it may be\nthought I have wept; for I must speak in passion, and I will do it\nin King Cambyses' vein.\n\nPRINCE.\nWell, here is my leg.\n\nFAL.\nAnd here is my speech.--Stand aside, nobility.\n\nHOST.\nO Jesu, this is excellent"

That thou art my son, I have partly thy mother's word,\npartly my own opinion; but chiefly a villainous trick of thine eye,\nand a foolish hanging of thy nether lip, that doth warrant me. If,\nthen, thou be son to me, here lies the point:  Why, being son to me,\nart thou so pointed at?\nShall the blessed Sun of heaven prove a micher, and eat blackberries?\na question not to be ask'd. Shall the son of England prove a thief,\nand take purses? "
b"a question to be ask'd.\nThere is a thing, Harry, which thou hast often heard of, and it is\nknown to many in our land by the name of pitch:  this pitch, as\nancient writers do report, doth defile; so doth the company thou\nkeepest:  for, Harry, now I do not speak to thee in drink, but in\ntears; not in pleasure, but in passion; not in words only,\nbut in woes also.  And yet there is a virtuous man whom I have\noften noted in thy company, but I know not his name.\n\nPRINCE.\nWhat manner of man, an it like your Majesty?\n\nFAL.\nA goodly portly man, i'faith, and a corpulent; of a cheerful look,\na pleasing eye, and a most noble carriage; and, as I think, his age\nsome fifty, or, by'r Lady, inclining to threescore; and now I\nremember me, his name is Falstaff:  if that man should be lewdly given,\nhe deceiveth me; for, Harry, I see virtue in his looks.\nIf, then, the tree may be known by the fruit, as the fruit by the tree,\nthen, peremptorily I speak it, there is virtue in that Falstaff:  him\nkeep with, the rest banish. And tell"
b" me now, thou naughty varlet, tell\nme where hast thou been this month?\n\nPRINCE.\nDost thou speak like a king? Do thou stand for me, and I'll play\nmy father.\n\nFAL.\nDepose me! if thou dost it half so gravely, so majestically, both\nin word and matter, hang me up by the heels for a rabbit-sucker or a\npoulter's hare.\n\nPRINCE.\nWell, here I am set.\n\nFAL.\nAnd here I stand.--Judge, my masters.\n\nPRINCE.\nNow, Harry, whence come you?\n\nFAL.\nMy noble lord, from Eastcheap.\n\nPRINCE.\nThe complaints I hear of thee are grievous.\n\nFAL.\n'Sblood, my lord, they are false.--Nay, I'll tickle ye for a\nyoung prince, i'faith.\n\nPRINCE.\nSwearest thou, ungracious boy? henceforth ne'er look on me. Thou art\nviolently carried away from grace:  there is a devil haunts thee, in\nthe likeness of an old fat man,--a tun of man is thy companion. Why\ndost thou converse with that trunk of humours, that bolting-hutch of\nbeastliness, that swollen parcel of dropsies, that huge bombard of\nsack, that roasted Manningtree ox with the pudding in his belly, tha"

That he is old,--(the more the pity,--his white hairs do\nwitness it. If sack and sugar be a fault, God help the wicked! if to\nbe old and merry be a sin, then many an old host that I know is damn'd:\nif to be fat be to be hated, then Pharaoh's lean kine are to be loved.\nNo, my good lord:  banish Peto, banish Bardolph, banish Pointz; but,\nfor sweet Jack Falstaff, kind Jack Falstaff, tr"

Yet let me wonder, Harry,\nAt thy affections, which do hold a wing\nQuite from the flight of all thy ancestors.\nThy place in Council thou hast rudely lost,\nWhich by thy younger brother is supplied;\nAnd art almost an alien to the hearts\nOf all the Court and princes of my blood:\nThe hope and expectation of thy time\nIs ruin'd; and the soul of every man\nProphetically does forethink thy fall.\nHad I so lavish of my presence been,\nSo common-hackney'd in the eyes of men,\nSo stale and cheap to vulgar company,\nOpinion, that did help me to the crown,\nHad still kept loyal to possession,\nAnd left me in reputeless banishment,\n\nA fellow of no mark nor likelihood.\nBy being seldom seen, I could not stir\nBut, like a comet, I was wonder'd at;\nThat men would tell their children, This is he;\nOthers would say, Where, which is Bolin"
b"gbroke?\nAnd then I stole all courtesy from Heaven,\nAnd dress'd myself in such humility,\nThat I did pluck allegiance from men's hearts,\nLoud shouts and salutations from their mouths,\nEven in the presence of the crowned King.\nThus did I keep my person fresh and new;\nMy presence, like a robe pontifical,\nNe'er seen but wonder'd at:  and so my state,\nSeldom but sumptuous, showed like a feast,\nAnd won by rareness such solemnity.\nThe skipping King, he ambled up and down\nWith shallow jesters and rash bavin wits,\nSoon kindled and soon burnt; carded his state,\nMingled his royalty, with capering fools;\nHad his great name profaned with their scorns;\nAnd gave his countenance, against his name,\nTo laugh at gibing boys, and stand the push\nOf every beardless vain comparative;\nGrew a companion to the common streets,\nEnfeoff'd himself to popularity;\nThat, being dally swallow'd by men's eyes,\nThey surfeited with honey, and began\nTo loathe the taste of sweetness, whereof a little\nMore than a little is by much too much.\nSo, when "
b"he had occasion to be seen,\nHe was but as the cuckoo is in June,\nHeard, not regarded; seen, but with such eyes\nAs, sick and blunted with community,\nAfford no extraordinary gaze,\nSuch as is bent on sun-like majesty\nWhen it shines seldom in admiring eyes;\nBut rather drowsed, and hung their eyelids down,\nSlept in his face, and render'd such aspect\nAs cloudy men use to their adversaries,\nBeing with his presence glutted, gorged, and full.\nAnd in that very line, Harry, stand'st thou;\nFor thou hast lost thy princely privilege\nWith vile participation:  not an eye\nBut is a-weary of thy common sight,\nSave mine,"
b" which hath desired to see thee more;\nWhich now doth that I would not have it do,\nMake blind itself with foolish tenderness.\n\nPRINCE.\nI shall hereafter, my thrice-gracious lord,\nBe more myself.\n\nKING.\nFor all the world,\nAs thou art to this hour, was Richard then\nWhen I from France set foot at Ravenspurg;\nAnd even as I was then is Percy now.\nNow, by my sceptre, and my soul to boot,\nHe hath more worthy interest to the state\nThan thou, the shadow of succession;\nFor, of no right, nor colour like to right,\nHe doth fill fields with harness in the realm,\nTurns head against the lion's armed jaws;\nAnd, being no more in debt to years than thou,\nLeads ancient lords and reverend bishops on\nTo bloody battles and to bruising arms.\nWhat never-dying honour hath he got\nAgainst renowned Douglas! whose high deeds,\nWhose hot incursions, and great name in arms,\nHolds from all soldiers chief majority\nAnd military title capital\nThrough all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ:\nThrice hath this Hotspur, Mars in swathing-clothes,\nThi"
b"s infant warrior, in his enterprises\nDiscomfited great Douglas; ta'en him once,\nEnlarged him, and made a friend of him,\nTo fill the mouth of deep defiance up,\nAnd shake the peace and safety of our throne.\nAnd what say you to this? Percy, Northumberland,\nTh' Archbishop's Grace of York, Douglas, and Mortimer\nCapitulate against us, and are up.\nBut wherefore do I tell these news to thee?\nWhy, Harry, do I tell thee of my foes,\nWhich art my near'st and dearest enemy?\nThou that art like enough,--through vassal fear,\nBase inclination, and the start of spleen,--\nTo fight against me under Percy's pay,\nTo dog his heels, and curtsy at his frowns,\nTo show how much thou art degenerate.\n\nPRINCE.\nDo not think so; you shall not find it so:\nAnd God forgive them that so much have sway'd\nYour Majesty's good thoughts away from me!\nI will redeem all this on Percy's head,\nAnd, in the closing of some glorious day,\nBe bold to tell you that I am your son;\nWhen I will wear a garment all of blood,\nAnd stain my favour in a bloody mask,\nW"
b"hich, wash'd away, shall scour my shame with it:\nAnd that shall be the day, whene'er it lights,\nThat this same child of honour and renown,\nThis gallant Hotspur, this all-praised knight,\nAnd your unthought-of Harry, chance to meet.\nFor every honour sitting on his helm,\nWould they were multitudes, and on my head\nMy shames redoubled! for the time will come,\nThat I shall make this northern youth exchange\nHis glorious deeds for my indignities.\nPercy is but my factor, good my lord,\nT' engross up glorious deeds on my behalf;\nAnd I will call hall to so strict account,\nThat he shall render every glory up,\nYea, even the slightest worship of his time,\nOr I will tear the reckoning from his heart.\nThis, in the name of God, I promise here:\nThe which if I perform, and do survive,\nI do beseech your Majesty, may salve\nThe long-grown wounds of my intemperance:\nIf not, the end of life cancels all bands;\nAnd I will die a hundred thousand deaths\nEre break the smallest parcel of this vow.\n\nKING.\nA hundred thousand rebels die in th"

I press'd me none but such\ntoasts-and-butter, with hearts in their bodies no bigger than\np"
b"ins'-heads, and they have bought out their services; and now\nmy whole charge consists of ancients, corporals, lieutenants,\ngentlemen of companies, slaves as ragged as Lazarus in the\npainted cloth, where the glutton's dogs licked his sores; and\nsuch as, indeed, were never soldiers, but discarded unjust\nserving-men, younger sons to younger brothers, revolted tapsters,\nand ostlers trade-fallen; the cankers of a calm world and a long\npeace; ten times more dishonourable ragged than an old faced\nancient:  and such have I, to fill up the rooms of them that have\nbought out their services, that you would think that I had a\nhundred and fifty tattered Prodigals lately come from\nswine-keeping, from eating draff and husks.

There's but a shirt and a half in all my company;\nand the half-shirt is two napkins tack'd together and thrown over the\nshoulders like a herald's coat without sleeves; and the shirt, to say\nthe truth, stolen from my host at Saint Alban's, or the red-nose\ninnkeeper of Daventry.\nBut that's all one; they'll find linen enough on every hedge.\n\n[Enter Prince Henry and Westmoreland.]\n\nPRINCE.\nHow now, blown Jack! how now, quilt!\n\nFAL.\nWhat, Hal! how now, mad wag! what a devil dost thou in\nWarwickshire?--My good Lord of Westmoreland, I cry you mercy:\nI thought your honour had already been at Shrewsbury.\n\nWEST.\nFaith, Sir John, 'tis more than time that I were there, and you too;\nbut my powers are there already.

If that the King\nHave any way your good deserts forgot,\nWhich he confesseth to be manifold,\nHe bids you name your griefs; and with all speed\nYou shall have your desires with"
b" interest,\nAnd pardon absolute for yourself and these\nHerein misled by your suggestion.\n\nHOT.\nThe King is kind; and well we know the King\nKnows at what time to promise, when to pay.\nMy father and my uncle and myself\nDid give him that same royalty he wears;\nAnd--when he was not six-and-twenty strong,\nSick in the world's regard, wretched and low,\nA poor unminded outlaw sneaking home--\nMy father gave him welcome to the shore:\nAnd--when he heard him swear and vow to God,\nHe came but to be Duke of Lancaster,\nTo sue his livery and beg his peace,\nWith tears of innocence and terms of zeal--\nMy father, in kind heart and pity moved,\nSwore him assistance, and performed it too.\nNow, when the lords and barons of the realm\nPerceived Northumberland did lean to him,\nThe more and less came in with cap and knee;\nMet him in boroughs, cities, villages,\nAttended him on bridges, stood in lanes,\nLaid gifts before him, proffer'd him their oaths,\nGive him their heirs as pages, follow'd him\nEven at the heels in golden multitudes.\nHe p"

b" Enter Worcester and Vernon.]\n\nHow, now, my Lord of Worcester! 'tis not well\nThat you and I should meet upon such terms\nAs now we meet.

But in short space\nIt rain'd down fortune showering on your head;\nAnd such a flood of greatness fell on you,--\nWhat with our help, what with the absent King,\nWhat with the injuries of a wanton time,\nThe seeming sufferances that you had borne,\nAnd the contrarious winds that held the King\nSo long in his unlucky Irish wars\nThat all in England did repute him dead,--\nAnd, from this swarm of fair advantages,\nYou took occasion to be quickly woo'd\n"

b"\nUnless a brother should a brother dare\nTo gentle exercise and proof of arms.\nHe gave you all the duties of a man;\nTrimm'd up your praises with a princely tongue;\nSpoke your deservings like a chronicle;\nMaking you ever better than his praise,\nBy still dispraising praise valued with you;\nAnd, which became him like a prince indeed,\nHe made a blushing cital of himself;\nAnd chid his truant youth with such a grace,\nAs if he master'd there a double spirit,\nOf teaching and of learning instantly.\nThere did he pause:  but let me tell the world,\nIf he outlive the envy of this day,\nEngland did never owe so sweet a hope,\nSo much misconstrued in his wantonness.\n\nHOT.\nCousin, I think thou art enamoured\nUpon his follies: never did I hear\nOf any prince so wild o' liberty.\nBut be he as he will, yet once ere night\nI will embrace him with a soldier's arm,\nThat he shall shrink under my courtesy.--\nArm, arm with speed:  and, fellows, soldiers, friends,\nBetter consider what you have to do\nThan I, that have not well the gift of ton"
b"gue,\nCan lift your blood up with persuasion.\n\n[Enter a Messenger.]\n\nMESS.\nMy lord, here are letters for you.\n\nHOT.\nI cannot read them now.--\nO gentlemen, the time of life is short!\nTo spend that shortness basely were too long,\nIf life did ride upon a dial's point,\nStill ending at th' arrival of an hour.\nAn if we live, we live to tread on kings;\nIf die, brave death, when princes die with us!\nNow, for our consciences, the arms are fair,\nWhen the intent of bearing them is just.\n\n[Enter another Messenger.]\n\nMESS.\nMy lord, prepare:  the King comes on apace.\n\nHOT.\nI thank him, that he cuts me from my tale,\nFor I profess not talking; only this,\nLet each man do his best:  and here draw I\nA sword, whose temper I intend to stain\nWith the best blood that I can meet withal\nIn the adventure of this perilous day.\nNow, Esperance! Percy! and set on.\nSound all the lofty instruments of war,\nAnd by that music let us all embrace;\nFor, Heaven to Earth, some of us never shall\nA second time do such a courtesy.\n\n[The trumpets sound."
b"  They embrace, and exeunt.]\n\n\n\nScene III. Plain between the Camps.\n\n[Excursions, and Parties fighting.  Alarum to the battle.\nThen enter Douglas and Sir Walter Blunt, meeting.]\n\nBLUNT.\nWhat is thy name, that in the battle thus\nThou crossest me? what honour dost thou seek\nUpon my head?\n\nDOUG.\nKnow, then, my name is Douglas,\nAnd I do haunt thee in the battle thus\nBecause some tell me that thou art a king.\n\nBLUNT.\nThey tell thee true.\n\nDOUG.\nThe Lord of Stafford dear to-day hath bought\nThy likeness; for, instead of thee, King Harry,\nThis sword hath ended him:  so shall it thee,\nUnless thou yield thee as my prisoner.\n\nBLUNT.\nI was not born a yielder, thou proud Scot;\nAnd thou shalt find a king that will revenge\nLord Stafford's death.\n\n[They fight, and Blunt is slain. Enter Hotspur.]\n\nHOT.\nO Douglas, hadst thou fought at Holmedon thus,\nI never had triumphed o'er a Scot.\n\nDOUG.\nAll's done, all's won; here breathless lies the King.\n\nHOT.\nWhere?\n\nDOUG.\nHere.\n\nHOT.\nThis, Douglas? no; I know this face full well:\nA gal"
b"lant knight he was, his name was Blunt;\nSemblably furnish'd like the King himself.\n\nDOUG.\nA fool go with thy soul, where're it goes!\nA borrow'd title hast thou bought too dear:\nWhy didst thou tell me that thou wert a king?\n\nHOT.\nThe King hath many marching in his coats.\n\nDOUG.\nNow, by my sword, I will kill all his coats;\nI'll murder all his wardrobe piece by piece,\nUntil I meet the King.\n\nHOT.\nUp, and away!\nOur soldiers stand full fairly for the day.\n\n[Exeunt.]\n\n[Alarums. Enter Falstaff.]\n\nFAL.\nThough I could 'scape shot-free at London, I fear the shot\nhere; here's no scoring but upon the pate.--Soft! who are you?\nSir Walter Blunt:  there's honour for you! here's no vanity! I am\nas hot as molten lead, and as heavy too:  God keep lead out of me!\nI need no more weight than mine own bowels. I have led my\nragamuffins where they are peppered:  there's not three of my\nhundred and fifty left alive; and they are for the town's end, to\nbeg during life. But who comes here?\n\n[Enter Prince Henry.]\n\nPRINCE.\nWhat, stand'st"
b" thou idle here? lend me thy sword:\nMany a nobleman lies stark and stiff\nUnder the hoofs of vaunting enemies,\nWhose deaths are yet unrevenged:  I pr'ythee,\nLend me thy sword.\n\nFAL.\nO Hal, I pr'ythee give me leave to breathe awhile. Turk\nGregory never did such deeds in arms as I have done this\nday. I have paid Percy, I have made him sure.\n\nPRINCE.\nHe is indeed; and living to kill thee.\nI pr'ythee, lend me thy sword.\n\nFAL.\nNay, before God, Hal, if Percy be alive, thou gett'st not\nmy sword; but take my pistol, if thou wilt.\n\nPRINCE.\nGive it me:  what, is it in the case?\n\nFAL.\nAy, Hal. 'Tis hot, 'tis hot:  there's that will sack a city.\n\n[The Prince draws out a bottle of sack.]\n\nWhat, is't a time to jest and dally now?\n\n[Throws it at him, and exit.]\n\nFAL.\nWell, if Percy be alive, I'll pierce him. If he do come in my\nway, so; if he do not, if I come in his willingly, let him make\na carbonado of me. I like not such grinning honour as Sir\nWalter hath:  give me life; which if I can save, so; if not,\nhonour comes unlo"
b"oked for, and there's an end.\n\n[Exit.]\n\n\n\nScene IV. Another Part of the Field.\n\n[Alarums. Excursions. Enter King Henry, Prince Henry,\nLancaster, and Westmoreland.]\n\nKING.\nI pr'ythee,\nHarry, withdraw thyself; thou bleedest too much.--\nLord John of Lancaster, go you unto him.\n\nLAN.\nNot I, my lord, unless I did bleed too.\n\nPRINCE.\nI do beseech your Majesty, make up,\nLest your retirement do amaze your friends.\n\nKING.\nI will do so.--\nMy Lord of Westmoreland, lead him to his tent.\n\nWEST.\nCome, my lord, I'll lead you to your tent.\n\nPRINCE.\nLead me, my lord?  I do not need your help:\nAnd God forbid, a shallow scratch should drive\nThe Prince of Wales from such a field as this,\nWhere stain'd nobility lies trodden on,\nAnd rebels' arms triumph in massacres!\n\nLAN.\nWe breathe too long:--come, cousin Westmoreland,\nOur duty this way lies; for God's sake, come.\n\n[Exeunt Lancaster and Westmoreland.]\n\nPRINCE.\nBy Heaven, thou hast deceived me, Lancaster;\nI did not think thee lord of such a spirit:\nBefore, I loved thee as a broth"
b"er, John;\nBut now I do respect thee as my soul.\n\nKING.\nI saw him hold Lord Percy at the point\nWith lustier maintenance than I did look for\nOf such an ungrown warrior.\n\nPRINCE.\nO, this boy\nLends mettle to us all!\n\n[Exit.]\n\n[Alarums. Enter Douglas.]\n\nDOUG.\nAnother king! they grow like Hydra's heads:\nI am the Douglas, fatal to all those\n\nThat wear those colours on them.--What art thou,\nThat counterfeit'st the person of a king?\n\nKING.\nThe King himself; who, Douglas, grieves at heart\nSo many of his shadows thou hast met,\nAnd not the very King. I have two boys\nSeek Percy and thyself about the field:\nBut, seeing thou fall'st on me so luckily,\nI will assay thee; so, defend thyself.\n\nDOUG.\nI fear thou art another counterfeit;\nAnd yet, in faith, thou bear'st thee like a king:\nBut mine I'm sure thou art, whoe'er thou be,\nAnd thus I win thee.\n\n[They fight; the King being in danger, re-enter Prince Henry.]\n\nPRINCE.\nHold up thy head, vile Scot, or thou art like\nNever to hold it up again! the spirits\nOf valiant Shirley, Sta"
b"fford, Blunt are in my arms:\nIt is the Prince of Wales that threatens thee;\nWho never promiseth but he means to pay.--\n\n[They fight:  Douglas flies.]\n\nCheerly, my lord:  how fares your Grace?\nSir Nicholas Gawsey hath for succour sent,\nAnd so hath Clifton:  I'll to Clifton straight.\n\nKING.\nStay, and breathe awhile:\nThou hast redeem'd thy lost opinion;\nAnd show'd thou makest some tender of my life,\nIn this fair rescue thou hast brought to me.\n\nPRINCE.\nO God, they did me too much injury\nThat ever said I hearken'd for your death!\nIf it were so, I might have let alone\nTh' insulting hand of Douglas over you,\nWhich would have been as speedy in your end\nAs all the poisonous potions in the world,\nAnd saved the treacherous labour of your son.\n\nKING.\nMake up to Clifton:  I'll to Sir Nicholas Gawsey.\n\n[Exit.]\n\n[Enter Hotspur.]\n\nHOT.\nIf I mistake not, thou art Harry Monmouth.\n\nPRINCE.\nThou speak'st as if I would deny my name.\n\nHOT.\nMy name is Harry Percy.\n\nPRINCE.\nWhy, then I see\nA very valiant rebel of the name.\nI am the"
b" Prince of Wales; and think not, Percy,\nTo share with me in glory any more:\nTwo stars keep not their motion in one sphere;\nNor can one England brook a double reign,\nOf Harry Percy and the Prince of Wales.\n\nHOT.\nNor shall it, Harry; for the hour is come\nTo end the one of us; and would to God\nThy name in arms were now as great as mine!\n\nPRINCE.\nI'll make it greater ere I part from thee;\nAnd all the budding honours on thy crest\nI'll crop, to make a garland for my head.\n\nHOT.\nI can no longer brook thy vanities.\n\n[They fight.]\n\n[Enter Falstaff.]\n\nFAL.\nWell said, Hal! to it, Hal! Nay, you shall find no boy's\nplay here, I can tell you.\n\n[Re-enter Douglas; he fights with Falstaff, who falls down as if\nhe were dead, and exit Douglas. Hotspure is wounded, and falls.]\n\nHOT.\nO Harry, thou hast robb'd me of my youth!\nI better brook the loss of brittle life\nThan those proud titles thou hast won of me;\nThey wound my thoughts worse than thy sword my flesh:\nBut thoughts the slave of life, and life Time's fool,\nAnd Time, that "
b"takes survey of all the world,\nMust have a stop. O, I could prophesy,\nBut that the earthy and cold hand of death\nLies on my tongue:  no, Percy, thou art dust,\nAnd food for--\n\n[Dies.]\n\nPRINCE.\nFor worms, brave Percy:  fare thee well, great heart!\nIll-weaved ambition, how much art thou shrunk!\nWhen that this body did contain a spirit,\nA kingdom for it was too small a bound;\nBut now two paces of the vilest earth\nIs room enough. This earth that bears thee dead\nBears not alive so stout a gentleman.\nIf thou wert sensible of courtesy,\nI should not make so dear a show of zeal:\nBut let my favours hide thy mangled face;\nAnd, even in thy behalf, I'll thank myself\nFor doing these fair rites of tenderness.\nAdieu, and take thy praise with thee to Heaven!\nThy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave,\nBut not remember'd in thy epitaph!--\n\n[Sees Falstaff on the ground.]\n\nWhat, old acquaintance? could not all this flesh\nKeep in a little life? Poor Jack, farewell!\nI could have better spared a better man:\nO, I should have a heavy m"
b"iss of thee,\nIf I were much in love with vanity!\nDeath hath not struck so fat a deer to-day,\nThough many dearer, in this bloody fray.\nEmbowell'd will I see thee by-and-by:\nTill then in blood by noble Percy lie.\n\n[Exit.]\n\nFAL.\n[Rising.] Embowell'd! if thou embowel me to-day, I'll give you leave\nto powder me and eat me too to-morrow. 'Sblood, 'twas time to\ncounterfeit, or that hot termagant Scot had paid me scot and lot too.\nCounterfeit! I lie; I am no counterfeit:  to die, is to be a\ncounterfeit; for he is but the counterfeit of a man who hath not the\nlife of a man:  but to counterfeit dying, when a man thereby liveth,\nis to be no counterfeit, but the true and perfect image of life indeed.\nThe better part of valour is discretion; in the which better part I\nhave saved my life.--\nZwounds, I am afraid of this gunpowder Percy, though he be dead:  how,\nif he should counterfeit too, and rise? by my faith, I am afraid he\nwould prove the better counterfeit. Therefore I'll make him sure; yea,\nand I'll swear I kill'd hi"
b"m. Why may not he rise as well as I?\nNothing confutes me but eyes, and nobody sees me. Therefore,\nsirrah, with a new wound in your thigh, come you along with me.\n\n[Takes Hotspur on his hack.]\n\n[Re-enter Prince Henry and Lancaster.]\n\nPRINCE.\nCome, brother John; full bravely hast thou flesh'd\nThy maiden sword.\n\nLAN.\nBut, soft! whom have we here?\nDid you not tell me this fat man was dead?\n\nPRINCE.\nI did; I saw him dead, breathless and bleeding\nUpon the ground.--\nArt thou alive? or is it fantasy\nThat plays upon our eyesight? I pr'ythee, speak;\nWe will not trust our eyes without our ears.\nThou art not what thou seem'st.\n\nFAL.\nNo, that's certain; I am not a double man:  but if I be not\nJack Falstaff, then am I a Jack. There is Percy!  [Throwing the\nbody down.] if your father will do me any honour, so; if not, let\nhim kill the next Percy himself. I look to be either earl or\nduke, I can assure you.\n\nPRINCE.\nWhy, Percy I kill'd myself, and saw thee dead.\n\nFAL.\nDidst thou?-- Lord, Lord, how this world is given to lying"
b"!--\nI grant you I was down and out of breath; and so was he:  but\nwe rose both at an instant, and fought a long hour by Shrewsbury\nclock. If I may be believed, so; if not, let them that should\nreward valour bear the sin upon their own heads. I'll take it upon\nmy death, I gave him this wound in the thigh:  if the man were\nalive, and would deny it, zwounds, I would make him eat a piece of\nmy sword.\n\nLAN.\nThis is the strangest tale that ever I heard.\n\nPRINCE.\nThis is the strangest fellow, brother John.--\nCome, bring your luggage nobly on your back:\nFor my part, if a lie may do thee grace,\nI'll gild it with the happiest terms I have.--\n\n[A retreat is sounded.]\n\nThe trumpet sounds retreat; the day is ours.\nCome, brother, let's to th' highest of the field,\nTo see what friends are living, who are dead.\n\n[Exeunt Prince Henry and Lancaster.]\n\nFAL.\nI'll follow, as they say, for reward. He that rewards me, God\nreward him! If I do grow great, I'll grow less; for I'll purge,\nand leave sack, and live cleanly as a nobleman "
b"should do.\n\n[Exit, bearing off the body.]\n\n\n\nScene V. Another Part of the Field.\n\n[The trumpets sound. Enter King Henry, Prince Henry,\nLancaster, Westmoreland, and others, with Worcester and\nVernon prisoners.]\n\nKING.\nThus ever did rebellion find rebuke.--\nIll-spirited Worcester! did not we send grace,\nPardon, and terms of love to all of you?\nAnd wouldst thou turn our offers contrary?\nMisuse the tenour of thy kinsman's trust?\nThree knights upon our party slain to-day,\nA noble earl, and many a creature else,\nHad been alive this hour,\nIf, like a Christian, thou hadst truly borne\nBetwixt our armies true intelligence.\n\nWOR.\nWhat I have done my safety urged me to;\nAnd I embrace this fortune patiently,\nSince not to be avoided it fails on me.\n\nKING.\nBear Worcester to the death, and Vernon too:\nOther offenders we will pause upon.--\n\n[Exeunt Worcester and Vernon, guarded.]\n\nHow goes the field?\n\nPRINCE.\nThe noble Scot, Lord Douglas, when he saw\nThe fortune of the day quite turn'd from him,\nThe noble Percy slain, and all"
b' his men\nUpon the foot of fear, fled with the rest;\nAnd, falling from a hill, he was so bruised\nThat the pursuers took him. At my tent\nThe Douglas is:  and I beseech your Grace\nI may dispose of him.\n\nKING.\nWith all my heart.\n\nPRINCE.\nThen, brother John of Lancaster, to you\nThis honourable bounty shall belong:\nGo to the Douglas, and deliver him\nUp to his pleasure, ransomless and free:\nHis valour, shown upon our crests to-day,\nHath taught us how to cherish such high deeds\nEven in the bosom of our adversaries.\n\nKING.\nThen this remains, that we divide our power.--\nYou, son John, and my cousin Westmoreland,\nTowards York shall bend you with your dearest speed,\nTo meet Northumberland and the prelate Scroop,\nWho, as we hear, are busily in arms:\nMyself,--and you, son Harry,--will towards Wales,\nTo fight with Glendower and the Earl of March.\nRebellion in this land shall lose his sway,\nMeeting the check of such another day;\nAnd since this business so fair is done,\nLet us not leave till all our own be won.\n\n[Exeunt.]\n\n\n\n'
