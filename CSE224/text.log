O, that it could be proved\nThat some night-tripping fairy had exchanged\nIn cradle-clothes our children where they lay,\nAnd call'd mine Percy, his Plantagenet!\nThen would I have his Harry, and he mine:\nBut let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,\nOf this young Percy's pride? the prisoners,\nWhich he in this adventure hath surprised,\nTo his own use he keeps; and sends me word,\nI shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife.\n\nWEST.\nThis is his uncle's teaching, this is Worcester,\nMalevolent to you in all aspects;\nWhich makes him prune himself, and bristle up\nThe crest of youth against your dignity.\n\nKING.\nBut I have sent for him to answer this;\nAnd for this cause awhile we must neglect\nOur holy purpose to Jerusalem.\nCousin, on Wednesday next our Council we\nWill hold at Windsor; so inform the lords:\nBut come yourself with speed to us again;\nFor more is to be said and to be done\nThan out of anger can be uttered.\n\nWEST.\nI will, my liege.\n\n\n[Exeunt.]\n\n\n\nScene II. The same. An Apartment of Prince Henry's.\n\n[Enter Prince Henry and Falstaff.]\n\nFAL.\nNow, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?\n\nPRINCE.\nThou art so fat-witted, with drinking of old sack, and\nunbuttoning thee after supper, and sleeping upon benches\nafter noon, that thou hast forgotten to demand that truly which\nthou wouldst truly know. What a devil hast thou to do with the\ntime of the day? unless hours were cups of sack, and minutes\ncapons, and the blessed Sun himself a fair hot wench in\nflame-coloured taffeta, I see no reason why thou shouldst be\nso superfluous to demand the time of the day.\n\nFAL.\nIndeed, you come near me now, Hal; for we that take purses go\nby the Moon and the seven stars, and not by Phoebus,--he, that\nwandering knight so fair. And I pr'ythee, sweet wag, when thou\nart king,--as, God save thy Grace--Majesty I should say, for\ngrace\nthou wilt have none,--\n\nPRINCE.\nWhat, none?\n\nFAL.\nNo, by my troth; not so much as will serve to be prologue\nto an egg and butter.\n\nPRINCE.\nWell, how then? come, roundly, roundly.\n\nFAL.\nMarry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not us that\nare squires of the night's body be called thieves of the day's\nbeauty:  let us be Diana's foresters, gentlemen of the shade,\nminions of the Moon; and let men say we be men of good\ngovernment, being governed, as the sea is, by our noble and\nchaste mistress the Moon, under whose countenance we steal.\n\n\nPRINCE.\nThou say'st well, and it holds well too; for the fortune of\nus that are the Moon's men doth ebb and flow like the sea,\nbeing governed, as the sea is, by the Moon. As, for proof, now: A\npurse of gold most resolutely snatch'd on Monday night, and most\ndissolutely spent on Tuesday morning; got with swearing Lay by,\nand spent with crying Bring in; now ill as low an ebb as the foot\nof the ladder, and by-and-by in as high a flow as the ridge of the\ngallows.\n\nFAL.\nBy the Lord, thou say'st true, lad.  And is not my hostess of the\ntavern a most sweet wench?\n\nPRINCE.\nAs the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle.  And is not a\nbuff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?\n\nFAL.\nHow now, how now, mad wag! what, in thy quips and thy\nquiddities? what a plague have I to do with a buff jerkin?\n\nPRINCE.\nWhy, what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern?\n\nFAL.\nWell, thou hast call'd her to a reckoning many a time and oft.\n\nPRINCE.\nDid I ever call for thee to pay thy part?\n\nFAL.\nNo; I'll give thee thy due, thou hast paid all there.\n\nPRINCE.\nYea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would stretch;\nand where it would not, I have used my credit.\n\nFAL.\nYea, and so used it, that, were it not here apparent that\nthou art heir-apparent--But I pr'ythee, sweet wag, shall there be\ngallows standing in England when thou art king? and\nresolution thus fobb'd as it is with the rusty curb of old father\nantic the law? Do not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief.\n\nPRINCE.\nNo; thou shalt.\n\nFAL.\nShall I? O rare! By the Lord, I'll be a brave judge.\n\nPRINCE.\nThou judgest false already:  I mean, thou shalt have the\nhanging of the thieves, and so become a rare hangman.\n\nFAL.\nWell, Hal, well; and in some sort it jumps with my humour;\nas well as waiting in the Court, I can tel"
